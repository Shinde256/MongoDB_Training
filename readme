MongoDB is a general-purpose, document-oriented, NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents to store data. Unlike tabular relations used in relational databases, JSON-like documents allow for flexible and dynamic schemas while maintaining simplicity. In general, NoSQL databases have the ability to scale horizontally, making them suitable for big data and real-time applications.

A database driver or connector is a program that connects an application to a database program. To perform CRUD operations in MongoDB using Python, a driver is required to establish the communication channel. PyMongo is the recommended driver for working with MongoDB from Python.

In this guide, you will write a Python script that creates, retrieves, updates, and deletes data in a locally installed MongoDB server on Ubuntu 20.04. In the end, you will acquire relevant skills to understand the underlying concepts in how data moves across MongoDB and a Python application.

Prerequisites
Before you move forward with this guide, you will need the following:

One Ubuntu 20.04 server with at least 1GB of RAM set up by following the Ubuntu 20.04 initial server setup guide, including a sudo non-root user and a firewall.

A Python 3 installation with an environment set up on Ubuntu 20.04 using this quick start guide.

An installation of the latest MongoDB server compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 using the How To install MongoDB on Ubuntu 20.04 guide.

A security configuration of MongoDB on Ubuntu 20.04 to prevent unauthorized access.
